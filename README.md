## Synopsis
Do you have a stochastic trajectory of ![math](http://mathurl.com/y8nuzht2.png) and need to compute ![math](http://mathurl.com/y7fw6bk4.png) or another arbitrary ![math](http://mathurl.com/ybzzbmxf.png) ? Then the function in this Python file will be useful for you.

## Usage
Usage is very easy. You simply call the function
```python
result = compute_stochastich_mean(x,y,bins,func)
```
Here, `x` is a member of `numpy.array` of  `N` elements and represents the time-like variable and `y` is also a numpy array of `N` elements and represents the coordinate-like variable (![math](http://mathurl.com/2ub7uy2.png) in the above description).
